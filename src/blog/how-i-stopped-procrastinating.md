I’ve always loved drawing and being creative. But I’ve also had big problems with procrastination and a feeling of not being productive enough. I recently managed to turn it around by accident with two changes I made to my life. The first thing was to create positive habits, and the second to change my mindset toward my art.

## Procrastination hell

I never had a problem coming up with ideas, the problem is to start working on them, and it’s even harder to actually finish something. Instead of using my time efficiently, I’d come up with excuses to avoid working on anything that was important to me. “I don't feel like doing it today, I’ll start tomorrow”, “This idea isn’t worth working on, I need to come up with a better one”, or “I need to practise more before I start, or else I’ll just waste my time”. These excuses sounded completely rational to me at the time, but when I found myself with an empty folder that should’ve been filled with completed artwork, I knew I had some kind of problem.

I could only do quick sketches and doodles, because I was afraid that if I put in more effort into my art, I’d be disappointed with the results. And to be fair, I was right, because the few times I attempted to put in any serious effort in my art, it turned out completely underwhelming and disappointing. It’s kind of embarrassing to admit, but my ego was bigger than my skills, and it only caused me problems. I’m all for self-confidence and being happy with yourself, but creating a false image of yourself is useless and detrimental to your growth.

## Art is never good enough

What’s tricky about art is that it’s hard to define what’s “good enough”. It can always get better, and you don’t want to get stuck in a rut and never improve. So every time I finished an illustration, I focused on what could be improved, the things that weren’t good enough. But that led me down the road of never being happy with what I finished, and I started feeling bad about it. I didn’t want to finish anything, because I knew I would be disappointed in the end. Every time I worked on my art, I’d feel bad about it. And that made it harder to get started the next time. Just thinking about doing art gave me a bad feeling, like I had failed even before I started.

I was worrying about wasting time, but in the end I wasted a lot of time by procrastinating. Instead of working on my art, it was easier to turn to youtube or reading about useless crap on twitter. I was disappointed in myself because I was so unproductive, but I was also disappointed in myself when I worked on my art. No matter what I did, I felt like I couldn’t win.

So how can you be focused on improving, but still be happy with your art and not beating yourself up about it?

## The solution is really boring!

As with a lot of things, the solution to this problem is kind of boring. In August I decided to start bullet journaling in order to get more organized, and with it I started to track my habits. I decided on five habits that I’d do everyday:

- Drawing
- Writing
- Reading
- Meditation
- Exercise 

I didn’t have to do anything overly ambitious, only something that would enforce these habits. For example, exercise could be a 30 minute walk or bike ride. If I meditate for ten minutes it still counts. Or opening my notebook to write a five minute story. A one-minute chicken scratch passes if I’m feeling generous. The habit tracker doesn’t care about the results, only if you do the habit or not. In other words, it’s very easy to succeed. Almost easier than watching youtube or scrolling through twitter.

Of course, you don’t have to do the exact same habits as the five above. But I do think that meditation and exercise are really important (even if they’re boring, sorry about that). I’ve noticed that I have much more energy and less negative thoughts since I started doing them every day, and that helps me with doing the other ones on the list, like writing and drawing.

## Why it got easier to finish art

By forcing myself to work on my art every day, something started to change. It got much easier to finish art, and I was no longer trapped in doodles and one-minute chicken-scratches. I had escaped procrastination hell! But my habits didn’t force me to finish anything, they could only get me started on stuff. So how come it got so much easier to actually finish things?

In addition to the habit tracker, I also decided to change my mindset toward creating art. Instead of putting a lot of value into how my art turned out, I started to celebrate each time I finished something. My art was still as bad, but I started to feel good about doing it anyways. I changed the definition of success from “creating perfect art”, to “just do the damn work and be done with it”. I still want to improve, and find an infinite amount of mistakes in everything I make, but it doesn’t hold me back anymore. Every time I finish something, I force myself to feel proud about it and it actually works. And it makes me want to work on my art next time, because now I know it will feel nice whenever I finish something!

## Ok, so what happened then?

After I made these two changes, I noticed that it became much easier to work on my art, and I felt better about it. I no longer have to argue with myself if I should get started or not, I just sit down and do the work. My empty folder started to fill up.

I finally started working on my comic that I’ve been thinking about for six months and procrastinated on doing. I’ve wanted to make comics for years, but could never get past 5-10 pages without giving up. Now I’m on page 30 and still going. I look forward to creating new pages instead of dreading it. Each page feels like an achievement, regardless if the art is sucky. I know I’m not the best, but if I don’t keep working on it I won’t get better.

Now, I can be happy and feel nice when finishing artwork, while still allowing myself to see the mistakes. I create a lot of crappy illustrations, but with each crappy piece I feel proud and like I’m slowly getting better. I feel invested in my art and I’m not afraid of screwing up. Learning how to finish things is an art in and of itself.
